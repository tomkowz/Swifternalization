/**
Swifternalization contains some built-in country-related shared expressions.
Developer can create its own expressions in expressions.json file for
base and preferred languages.

The class is responsible for proper loading the built-in shared ones and
those loaded from project's files. It handles overriding of built-in and loads
those from Base and preferred language version.

It always load base expressions, then looking for language specific.
If in Base are some expressions that overrides built-ins, that's fine.
The class adds developer's custom expressions and adds only those of built-in
that are not contained in the Base.

The same is for preferred languages but also here what is important is that
at first preferred language file expressions are loaded, then if something
different is defined in Base it will be also loaded and then the built-in
expression that differs.
