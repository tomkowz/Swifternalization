    Method takes base and prefered language translations and also shared

    allow them to be used by framework later. It fit to the rule of how system 
    localization mechanism work, that when there is no prefered language 
    translation it takes base one if exists and return translation.
    
    Shared expressions are used to replace shared-expression-keys from loaded 
    translations and use resolved full shared expressions from file with 
    expressions as well as built-in ones. Translations are processed in shared 
    expressions processor.
